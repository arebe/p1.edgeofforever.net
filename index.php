<h2>Hello. My name is Rachel Boyce.</h2>
<p>I'm a data and project manager at the Harvard Center for Population and
Development Studies. I occasionally take on freelance WordPress
projects, so I am excited to learn more about PHP. I really enjoyed learning Processing last
semester, it appealed to my interests in creative computing and new
media art. I am a painter and video artist, DJ, and bicyclist. I have
a cat named Fox, who is reading over my shoulder.</p>
<p>My favorite text editor is Aquamacs, which is what I'm using to
write this. </p>
